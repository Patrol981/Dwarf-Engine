# What's Dwarf Engine?

Dwarf is a game engine targeting C-RPG and RTS genres because author is
passionate about theese :relaxed:, so it will work best with this type of games
but do feel free to create any other game with it!

# Features

- 3D/2D environment
- Native AOT compatible
- Customizable system pipeline
- Entity component system
- Modern graphics API using Vulkan

# Platform Support

| Platform | Is supported       |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Windows  | :white_check_mark: |
| Linux    | :white_check_mark: |
| MacOS    | :x:                |
| Android  | :x:                |
| iOS      | :x:                |

Engine supports for now only Windows and Linux platform, because I'm using
Vulkan 1.4. When MoltenVk capabilities will be close enough to this version
MacOS port will be here aswell :sunglasses:

Android support is planned too along with iOS but not in the nearest future
:confounded:

# Scripting

For now the only language that is fully supported is C#, allthough I'm planning
to publish official bindings for both TypeScript and Python

# Building

There are/will be 3 diffrent ways to create games using the engine

## 1. Using as project dependency in your .csproj

It's fairly simple, just clone repo and add it to your client project and you're
good to go

## 2. Importing as .DLL

You can precompile engine, since it is a Library project it will output .DLL
files for you to use. Then in your .csproj you have to specify dlls that you'll
be using:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
	<Reference  Include="Dwarf">
		<HintPath>dlls\Dwarf.dll</HintPath>
	</Reference>
	<Reference  Include="Dwarf.AbstractionLayer">
		<HintPath>dlls\Dwarf.AbstractionLayer.dll</HintPath>
	</Reference>
</ItemGroup>
```

## 3. Using Dwarf Foundry (WIP)

You may got the feeling that creating project with Dwarf.dll can be a bit tricky
to get it right, hence there is an official launcher in development that will
improve your experience. When it will be ready You will find link to download
